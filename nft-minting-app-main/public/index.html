      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

            Long after the extinction of humans and the passing of Earth, there lived a ReGen named Two3. 
      A digital nomad and survivor of the 2023 Glitch. Two3 is set out to explore the new and vast unnatural world of META. 
      He hopes to collect more ▪️, to build the Lost Ones, the holy grail to Two3’s culture that was lost during the catastrophic Glitch. 
      More than half the Earth and other life forms only survived by regenerating themselves from the pixelated resources
      scavenged after the Glitch, calling themselves ReGens.
          <br/>
          <br/>
           In order to step deeper into the META, his elder gave him the last 123 ▪️ 
      to build the first BC1 Sneaker. Two3 is on a mission to find 2,460 ▪️ 
      to build the first 20 Blockchain Sneakers for the ReGen Heirs, the 555088-602. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
      to be continued…
